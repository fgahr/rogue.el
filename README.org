* rogue.el -- A Simple Roguelike for Emacs
  This is mainly a learning project to familiarize myself with basic Emacs
  programming.

  Inspired by 7drl, although having no playing experience, I decided to try my
  hand at a little roguelike myself. The limitations of Elisp as a language
  do not really hurt here.

  As of now, I have no idea how to properly distribute Elisp code. For now,
  open the =rogue.el= file, then ~M-x eval-buffer~ and ~M-x rogue~.

  I will attempt to add some in-game documentation when the game matures and
  there are actually interesting things to do.
